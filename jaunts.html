        <h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px">After Cyclops and Jane Doe manage to escape from the Creature, they make their way towards the main resupply room of RED. Cyclops opens the gate door with his ID and the two make their way inside to grab weapons and ammunition, passing by the corpses of the RED mercenaries, who seem to be completely dead. While Cyclops examines the supplies located behind the glass door, Jane finds and plays a tape recorder that the deceased RED Engineer was holding. The tape has a recording of the Hunter saying: "It's longer than you think. I've seen the other side. It's longer than you think."

          <h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px"> After the tape stops playing, Cyclops grabs the crowbar from Jane and smashes through the glass door, setting off an alarm. They arm themselves and prepare to leave, but then they bear witness to seeing the undead mercenaries coming back to life. The Jaunts slowly move towards them, but have trouble getting through the doorway. The Sniper is crushed by the door and torn in half, yet still manages to crawl closer. Cyclops shoots and kills the Sniper, while the other Jaunts still struggle to enter. Jane shoots the Heavy which causes the large zombie to fall on top of the other Jaunts, giving them a brief moment to escape, but the gate door suddenly shuts, leaving them trapped inside to die with the Jaunts.
            
          <h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px">  Jane and Cyclops open fire on the Jaunts, to no avail. Jane aims and fires at the Soldier's leg, and Cyclops fires at the ceiling light, sending it tumbling down and electrocuting the Engineer. With only the Heavy and Scout left, Jane notices the gasoline on top of the resupply cabinet and heads for it. Cyclops punches the Scout aside and Jane takes cover behind the cabinet and shoots the Heavy. The Scout then turns his attention towards Jane, but he is quick enough to push over the resupply cabinet, which crushes and kills the Scout. The gasoline falls to the ground and spills around the broken ceiling light from earlier, igniting as the fuel spills out. The Heavy begins to recover from the shot but before he can react, the ceiling light explodes in his face, killing him. The Soldier, still incapacitated, groans one last time before Cyclops shoots him dead. After managing to kill the Jaunts, the gate door opens and the duo leave the resupply room.</h3>

    <h1  style="color: white;margin: 20px">Similarly to <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="creature.html">the Creature,</a> the Jaunts do not possess any human characteristics and are quite simple-minded, solely focusing on killing Jane Doe and Cyclops. Outside of their apparent blood-thirst, the Jaunts are shown to not be very intelligent or strategic, as seen when they tried to barge inside the room Jane and Cyclops were in at once instead of one at a time.</h3>

             style="color: white;">Jeremy E., also known as The Creature is a minor antagonist in the 2023 YouTube psychological horror SFM movie, Emesis Blue. It is a former Scout, zombified and mutated beyond recognition by the side-effects of the Respawn Machine.

          <h2 style="color: white;">  The Creature is seemingly a mindless beast, attacking everything and everyone who crosses its path, including its own teammates. Following the destruction of Conagher Slaughterhouse, the Creature seems to be the only surviving member of the team of mercenaries.

<h2 style="color: white; margin: 20px">Backround
    <h3 style="color: white; margin: 20px">Although an explicit backstory for the Creature is never given, it's certain that it was one of many clones of the sentenced prisoner Jeremy E., also known as the Scout, created by the Respawn Machine and Mann Co. industries.

     <h3 style="color: white; margin: 20px"> It's implied that the specific clone that would become the Creature had been a BLU Scout since he's seen in Jane Doe's deluded "flashbacks" of a twisted interpretation of the Gravel Wars. In this very same flashback, he receives a bullet to the head and eventually mutates into the undead monster that he now is, heavily implying that the injury caused his Respawn to fail and turn him into the Creature.</h2>

        <h3 style="color: white; margin: 20px">The Creature is one of the Conagher Slaughterhouse Mercs. It is first barely seen hiding in a dark room from Fritz, and ducks behind a wall when spotted. It is later fully seen when it attempts to chase after Soldier and Cyclops; the chase ending with it being stabbed in the head by Soldier, and kicked down a flight of stairs.

            <h3 style="color: white; margin: 20px">    After Soldier and Cyclops fend off the Jaunts, Soldier returns to the stairs, but finds the Creature gone. As the two - now joined by Fritz - fend off Stalingrad they are cornered in an elevator, only for the Creature to intercept and attack <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="stalingrad.html">Stalingrad</a> .
            
                
                <h3 style="color: white; margin: 20px">   The Creature, while not visible, returns to chase Soldier beneath the Slaughterhouse, filling the sewer tunnels with its inhuman howls. It is unclear whether the Creature was ultimately finished off by Stalingrad, or otherwise killed by the Slaughterhouse collapsing.</h2>

                <h2 style="color: white; margin: 20px">The Creature resembles a Scout with long, blood-covered fingers and torn black clothing, making it unclear whether he originally served RED or BLU team. Its eyes have dark circles and no pupils. It is taller than Soldier, who is estimated to be around 6'5 feet tall, so the Creature is likely around 7 ft.</h2>

        <h1 style="color: white;margin: 20px">Personality</h1>
        <hr>
<h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">The Respawn Machine has completely deprived the Scout from any and all human behavior and personality, instead turning him into a mindless killing machine that viciously attacks everyone that crosses his sight, including his own teammates.

    <h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">  It's likely that, much like the current Jeremy E., this lack of a humane personality stems from a brain condition caused by the Respawn Machine's reconstruction of his brain.</h2>

    <h1 style="color: white;margin: 20px">Trivia</h1>
<hr>
<h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">he howls the Creature emits when chasing Soldier underneath the Slaughterhouse are similar to the sounds made by a death whistle, a device infamous for the inhuman screams it emits when used.
<h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">   The Creature's appearance may be based off of SCP-096.
    <h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">   Scout's name, Jeremy E., is a reference to the famous Twitch streamer Jerma985, whose real name is Jeremy Elbertson.</h2>

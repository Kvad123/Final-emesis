        <h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px;">He is first seen trying to kill Soldier and the Detective. After Soldier pretends to die from being shot by him he grabs his rocket launcher and fires it at The Hunter and as he tries to run away the explosion blows off his right leg. Before he bleeds to death and comes back as The Hunter he takes the bullets out of the Detective's revolver so his friend <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="butcher.html">the Butcher</a>  can take as a captive, even laughing before his first demise. He is later seen back from the dead with a long metal pole in place of his missing limb trying to hunt down and kill the Soldier first using a Sniper rifle and then later using a rocket launcher. Before he can kill Soldier he sees what he thinks is <a style="color: white;" href="butcher.html">the Butcher </a>  only to see it's only the Butcher's head as Fritz Ludwig mutilates him with the axe he used to behead the Butcher, Before the Soldier kills him.</h2>

<div> <h2 style="color: white; margin: 20px;">In death he resembles the RED sniper except that now with black clothing, as well as his face is literally deathly pale with a rictus grin, broken glasses pure white eyes and a metal peg leg with a blood stained hat.</h2></div>

        <div><h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">After his resurrection, he is hellbent on revenge on the Soldier and is of course, is more talkative then his partner in crime. He is also shown to have standards, as he questions Soldier if he really wants to die for Jules Archibald instead of something worth dying for, even calling him a "Fat bastard".</div>

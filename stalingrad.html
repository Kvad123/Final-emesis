             style="color: white;">Mikhail, also known as Stalingrad or as The Russian in the screenplay, and formerly as the BLU Heavy Weapons Guy is the secondary antagonist of the 2023 YouTube psychological horror SFM movie, Emesis Blue.</h3>
      <h2  style="color: white;">Formerly the BLU Heavy Weapons Guy, Stalingrad now works for the Conagher Brothers, two sadistic Engineers who run the Conagher Slaughterhouse and the horrors that it houses. That was until Detective Jacques Murnau and his personal assistant Jane Doe discover his betrayal, using him as their only lead towards the true nature of Jules Archibald's disappearance. Mikhail is killed by Jane in an altercation with Jacques, leading him to be resurrected by the <a style="color: white;" href="surgeon.html">Conagher Slaughterhouse Medic</a> and turned into a mindless, undead brute donning a skull mask.</h3>

<h1  style="color: white;margin: 20px">Backround</h1>
<h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px">Little is known about Stalingrad's backstory, but it can be inferred that it's near-identical to his game counterpart's backstory.

   <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px"> He was one of the 100 death row prisoners tested for "Respawn Compability", and one of the 10 that managed to be compatible with the machine. Due to being legally dead, he was therefore considered "company property" for all means and purposes, forcing him and the other 8 mercenaries (the tenth one had committed suicide after going insane from the Respawn Machine) to fight endlessly in the Gravel Wars, orchestrated by the Mann Brothers and extended as long as humanly possible by Jules Archibald.
    
    <h3 style=" color: white;margin: 20px">Heavy was cloned and respawned multiple times by both RED and BLU teams after Jules secretly sold the Respawn Machine to both Blutarch and Redmond Mann, eventually leading him to go insane and rebel against the ones he held responsible for his pain by joining the Conagher Brothers.</h2>

<h1 style="color: white;margin: 20px">Emesis  Blue</h1>
<h3 style="color: white;">Stalingrad is first seen carrying a suitcase of unknown contents and as the only lead to the perpetrators of the kidnapping of Jules Archibald. He is confronted by Jacques in an alleyway, where he condemns him for his betrayal towards BLU before interrogating him about his employers and the contents of the suitcase. Stalingrad is seen heavily protective of the briefcase, immediately engaging with Jacques after the fact. After a brief one-sided battle favoring him, Stalingrad is eventually killed by Jane, but the suitcase he was carrying is later seen to be stolen by the Undertaker and taken to Conagher Slaughterhouse.

   <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px"> Stalingrad's corpse was also retrieved, and later used by the <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124)" href="surgeon.html">RED Medic</a>  as a test subject, leading him to become a zombie with inhuman strengths and durability. Stalingrad would later antagonize the BLUs located in the building, as well as Cyclops, a renegade RED Demoman who was lucky enough to not gone insane from the Respawn Machine.
    
    <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px">In his final confrontation with Jane Doe, as the Conagher Slaughterhouse was burning to the ground, he's tranquilly rushing towards him, not knowing that soon a tower from the building would collapse on him, apparently killing him.</h2>
<hr>
<h1 style="color: white; margin: 20px">Trivia</h1>
<h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px">Stalingrad's demeanor in undeath is heavily resembling of Nemesis from Capcom's Resident Evil saga, both being nigh-mindless brutes that are only seen repeating the enemy faction's name; S.T.A.R.S on Nemesis's case and BLU on Stalingrad's case. His appearance is also similar to Mr. X, also from the Resident Evil saga.</h2>

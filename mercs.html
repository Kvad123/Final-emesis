      <h2  style="color: white;margin: 20px;text-align: center;">The Conagher Slaughterhouse Mercenaries are the secondary antagonists of the 2023 YouTube psychological horror movie Emesis Blue.
        Formed from mercenaries from both sides of the Gravel Wars, the Slaughterhouse Mercenaries seek to exact their revenge on the people who turned them into "company property" and have caused them to go through "eternity" over and over again for their own personal gain, The Mann Brothers and Jules Archibald. Having been respawned, experimented on, and cloned for so long, the mercenaries have started to display varying degrees of insanity, diseases such as Brain Atrophy, and even physical mutations.</h1>

        <h1 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">Backround</h1>
        <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">At least months prior to October, 1968, the <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="conagher brother.html">Conagher Brothers </a> repurposed what was once the RED territory on 2Fort, serving as their own "Slaughterhouse." Having also gone insane, some mercenaries would join them, whereas some other mercenaries who were implied not to join like Cyclops are implied to have been incarcerated in the base.

          <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">The Slaughterhouse Mercs would be subject to a multitude of mutations, either caused by the <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="surgeon.html">Two-faced Medic</a> and Helix Corporation or by the Respawn Machine itself malfunctioning. Some of these mutations vary from physical disfigurement to a complete zombification of the individual.
            
           <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;"> Eventually, the Mercs would plan a scheme to kidnap the Governor of New Mexico and responsible for their current condition, Jules Archibald, succeeding through unknown means. Though it's later revealed that Jules himself had plotted his own "kidnapping" in order to give himself protection and to help his own campaign.

           <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">The kidnapping didn't go unnoticed, as Detective Jacques Murnau and his personal assistant, Jane Doe, had already been on the case and found a rather big lead on the case. After his execution by Jane Doe, leaving them without any leads, they eventually investigate the crime scene of a former BLU member, the Scout.

            <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">It's here where they find out that the Mercs had already executed the Scout's mother, as well as kidnapped him. Through the testimony of an injured policeman on the scene, they came to the conclusion that Scout's doctor and friend, Fritz Ludwig, was the perpetrator.
            
            <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">Meanwhile, Fritz was being tormented by the Mercs and taunting them about having kidnapped the Scout. He receives a lead on their location shortly after in the form of blood writing on one of his walls, reading "Conagher Slaughterhouse." After equipping himself with his old Medic equipment, he leaves for the Slaughterhouse. Unbeknownst to Fritz, Jane and Jacques were going to investigate his home in order to confront him about Scout, only to find the lead and deciding to go to the location as well.
            
            <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px;">After both arrive at different times, they are tormented by several of the Mercenaries in the place. Medic by Stalingrad prior to coming face to face against the <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="conagher brother.html">Conagher Brothers</a>, and Jacques and Jane by the Hunter, before encountering the Butcher who causes them to separate. Jane is then hunted by the Creature, leading to him encountering Cyclops, who appears to be the only sane RED team member left in the base, and teaming up with him.
            
            <h3  style="color: white; margin: 20px;">After this, the Mercenaries would fall one by one, the first being the ringmasters of the nightmare themselves, the <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="conagher brother.html">Conagher Brothers</a>, at the hands of Fritz, followed by <a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="jaunts.html">the Jaunts</a>, <a style="color:rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="surgeon.html">the Two-faced Medic</a>,<a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="butcher.html">the Butcher</a> ,<a style="color: rgb(167, 124, 124);" href="hunter.html">and the Hunter</a> . At the end, after hours of antagonizing the protagonists, most if not all of the Mercenaries would meet their long-awaited rest after the entire Slaughterhouse collapses on itself on a fire caused by Jacques, destroying the 2Fort Respawn Machine after years of literal eternal suffering.</h2>

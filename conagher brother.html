        <hr>
        <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px">The Conagher brothers have at least one younger brother named Dell, who had mysteriously gone missing before the events in 1968.

         <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px">   On Halloween 1968, the Conagher brothers kidnapped a Scout named Jeremy and locked him in a coffin. After Jeremy was rescued by Dr. Fritz Ludwig, Jeremy is then shot and wounded by Zed's turret before Zed tortures and kills Jeremy, which Dr. Ludwig was unfortunate enough to hear.
            
          <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px">  As this went on, Maynard receives a call from an unknown person. Maynard asks who he thought to be his brother, Dell, about how things were in Dustbowl. The person on the other side tells him that Dustbowl is gone, and Maynard inquires several times about his little brother. However, the person on the other side tells Maynard they have been compromised and insists to not let the briefcase out of their sight. The person on the other side also asks about how Jeremy got out and says he will be making his way back to the Slaughterhouse before hanging up.
            
           <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px"> While Maynard is playing on the piano, Ludwig attempts to strangle him with the phone cord before Maynard hits him with the phone and shoots him dead. However, while checking the disposal chute and telling whoever was on the other side he'll dispose of Dr. Ludwig's body, Dr. Ludwig comes back to life and beats Maynard to death before throwing him down the chute.
            
         
         
         
            <h3 style="color: white;margin: 20px"> Zed hears the commotion and enters the room to check on his brother, only to find Dr. Ludwig holding the controller to his turret. He attempts to dissuade Dr. Ludwig from activating the gun, but draws his drill, prompting Dr. Ludwig to fire at Zed, mortally wounding him. Zed suggests that he would've gotten Dr. Ludwig, indicating had he had a gun, he may have executed Ludwig before he activated the turret. Zed then laughs before Dr. Ludwig shoots Zed in the head with Maynard's shotgun, killing him.</h1>

        <hr>
        <h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px" >Zed and Maynard are both depicted to both be sadistic (although Zed is shown to be much more sadistic out of the duo) and love torturing people, as shown as when they tortured Jeremy to death with an electric drill. Zed is also depicted to be smarter than Maynard, as Maynard is more brawny.

          <h2 style="color: white;margin: 20px">  However, it is shown that Maynard does show to care for Zed, although Zed does treat him terribly, as shown as when Zed punches Maynard and by calls him a "dumbass". Maynard is also shown to care for Dell, concerningly asking on the phone what happened to him.</h2>
